                      Ashante, a California native, is a mother of three wonderful boys and the eldest of three girls. She had many dreams and aspirations, in which she was able to accomplish most of them. At the age of 17 years old, she joined United States Army Reserves and served for 8 years. As time progressed, she moved to Atlanta and decided to pursue a business degree. As fate had it, she explored a career in the Payroll Industry and eventually became an Implementation Consultant in Project Services. After giving birth to her second son, Ashante completed her Bachelor's degree, purchased a home and earned her Certified Payroll Professional certificate.  In 2011, Ashante decided to go back to school for her Master's degree in Project Management, which she completed the following year.

                      Ashante has had many fun experiences, such acting, becoming a fitness instructor and performing at an Atlanta Hawks game, to name a few. Even in all of those experiences, she finds joy in being a mother to her 3 sons. She has found time in her busy schedule to volunteer for their sports programs. Just recently, Ashante decided to enroll into UCLA Extension's Coding Bootcamp program, where she will learn to code computers, in hopes of expanding her knowledge and giving her sons a skillset that will benefit them in the years to come.
